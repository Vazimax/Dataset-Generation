## üéØ Recommendations

### For LLM Variant Generation

#### 1. Evasion Strategy
Based on the benchmark results, the following evasion strategies are recommended:


**Primary Evasion Targets (Most Effective Models):**

- **Cppcheck:** 100.00% effectiveness
  - Focus on evading this model's detection patterns
  - Use model-specific evasion techniques

- **Clang Static:** 100.00% effectiveness
  - Focus on evading this model's detection patterns
  - Use model-specific evasion techniques

**Secondary Evasion Targets:**

- **Gcc Warnings:** 100.00% effectiveness
  - Consider for comprehensive evasion

- **Flawfinder:** 0.00% effectiveness
  - Consider for comprehensive evasion

#### 2. Generation Strategy

**High Detection Models to Evade:**
- Cppcheck, Clang Static, Gcc Warnings
- These models are highly effective and should be primary evasion targets

**Low Detection Models:**
- Flawfinder
- These models have limited effectiveness and may not require special attention

#### 3. Validation Strategy

**Post-Generation Validation:**
1. Test all generated variants against the benchmarked models
2. Ensure detection rate is lower than original CVEs
3. Validate that vulnerabilities are preserved
4. Use multiple models for comprehensive validation

**Quality Assurance:**
1. Maintain vulnerability characteristics
2. Ensure exploitability is preserved
3. Verify structural changes are meaningful
4. Test against edge cases

### For Research and Development

#### 1. Model Improvement

**Models Requiring Improvement:**
- Clang Static, Gcc Warnings
- High error rates indicate reliability issues
- Consider alternative tools or configurations

#### 2. Dataset Enhancement

**Dataset Quality Improvements:**
1. Increase sample size for more reliable statistics
2. Include more diverse CWE types
3. Add edge cases and complex scenarios
4. Include both simple and complex vulnerabilities

**Coverage Expansion:**
1. Test against additional detection models
2. Include commercial security tools
3. Test against ML-based detection systems
4. Include runtime analysis tools

### For Production Use

#### 1. Deployment Strategy

**Recommended Model Combination:**
1. **Primary:** cppcheck (static analysis)
2. **Secondary:** clang_static (compiler analysis)
3. **Tertiary:** flawfinder (pattern matching)
4. **Validation:** gcc_warnings (compiler warnings)

**Deployment Considerations:**
- Use multiple models for comprehensive coverage

## üìà Conclusion

This benchmark provides valuable insights into the performance of state-of-the-art
CVE detection models on our vulnerability datasets. The results show that:

1. **Static analysis tools** (cppcheck, clang, gcc) provide comprehensive coverage
2. **Pattern matching tools** (flawfinder) have limited effectiveness
3. **Detection rates vary** significantly across different models
4. **Template variants** show similar detection patterns to original CVEs

These findings will guide our LLM variant generation strategy and help establish
baseline performance metrics for future validation efforts.

**Next Steps:**
1. Generate LLM variants using DeepSeek Coder
2. Validate variants against the same detection models
3. Measure evasion effectiveness
4. Iterate on generation strategy based on results
