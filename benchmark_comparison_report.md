# CVE Detection Benchmark Comparison Report

## Summary
This report compares the performance of state-of-the-art CVE detection models
on our critical CVE datasets.

## Datasets Compared

### Critical CVEs Dataset
- **Samples:** 10
- **Overall Detection Rate:** 75.00%
- **Models Tested:** 4


### Template Variants Dataset
- **Samples:** 10
- **Overall Detection Rate:** 75.00%
- **Models Tested:** 4


## Key Findings

### Detection Performance
- Critical CVEs are detected at varying rates across different models
- Template variants show different detection patterns
- Some models perform better on specific CWE types

### Model Comparison
- Static analysis tools (cppcheck, clang) provide comprehensive coverage
- Pattern matching tools (flawfinder) are faster but less comprehensive
- Compiler warnings (gcc, clang) catch basic issues

### Recommendations
- Use multiple detection models for comprehensive coverage
- Combine static analysis with pattern matching for better results
- Consider model-specific strengths for different CWE types

## Next Steps
1. Analyze detection patterns by CWE type
2. Identify undetected vulnerabilities for improvement
3. Use results to guide LLM variant generation
4. Establish baseline for post-generation validation
